This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# How It Works
Based on the proporsal that was handed to the profesor, we started working on some of the fucntionality for this final proyect. We have our React App to be the middle ground where users will come in to code in our drag and drop interface. This is our intermediate code, which for this first iteration of the proyect has been done in the way of taking whatever the user has put into our sandbox and handing it to file where our lexer and paser will be able to compile for it, to be displayed later on. 

In the future, we would like it that the server is the one that does that completely and we don't even have to download a file to the users computer and just do everything in the back end.
